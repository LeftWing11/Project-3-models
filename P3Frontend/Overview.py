    The objective of the project was to evaluate the correlation between changes in macroeconomic indicators and fluctuations in asset class prices. The project aimed to identify and categorize major macroeconomic indicators affecting asset prices, establish a quantifiable methodology to measure their impact, analyze historical data to assess correlation, and develop predictive models for forecasting potential changes in asset prices based on macroeconomic shifts
   
The core motivation behind our project is to understand the intricate relationship between macroeconomic indicators and fluctuations in asset class prices. We aimed to unravel how changes in key economic factors impact various asset classes, addressing the crucial need for a deeper comprehension of these dynamics in the financial landscape.


The fundamental hypothesis driving our project is that by identifying, categorizing, and quantifying the impact of major macroeconomic indicators, we can develop predictive models capable of forecasting potential changes in asset prices. This hypothesis lays the groundwork for informed decision-making in the volatile realm of financial markets.
